      <div class='content'><p>As I come back into work I’ve been reflecting on what roles I played in my previous jobs. I was especially curious to probe the ways in which I was different than the “standard” Data Scientist (if there even is one) and therefore what unique skills and attitudes I could contribute.</p>
<p>Initial reflections:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>rapid prototyper</p>
<ul>
<li>“dynamique”</li>
<li>web skills in common / simple frameworks</li>
<li>dashboard, interactive viz end-to-end creation</li>
<li>startups mentality (MVP, working on many different things, lots of breadth, learn fast, can work with people from very different teams &amp; backgrounds)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>ML engineer</p>
<ul>
<li>both eng &amp; conceptually</li>
<li>know &amp; understand the models, conceptually, modularly, and pros &amp; cons to domains</li>
<li>know how the model incorporates every stage from dataset acquisition, preprocessing, feature engineering, to how it is used commercially, to infrastructure, pipeline, iterating, testing, comparing, versioning models</li>
<li>diagnosing, logging</li>
<li>interpreting, understanding, explaining the model, identifying features, simplifying the model</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>team player, others in mind</p>
<ul>
<li>communication skills with different backgrounds</li>
<li>mentoring skills</li>
<li>documentation skills &amp; advocate</li>
<li>conceptually: the details, naming stuff, being clear, comments, reusable, modular code</li>
<li>VCS, git, sharing datasets, models, code, preprocessing code, sharing the whole pipeline so that anyone can work on it</li>
<li>collaboration</li>
<li>prise d’initiative, pioneer for something non-standard in DS</li>
<li>writing domain-specific APIs</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
