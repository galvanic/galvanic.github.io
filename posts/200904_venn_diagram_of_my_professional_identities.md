As I come back into work I’ve been reflecting on what roles I played in my previous jobs. I was especially curious to probe the ways in which I was different than the “standard” Data Scientist (if there even is one) and therefore what unique skills and attitudes I could contribute.

Initial reflections:

- rapid prototyper
  - “dynamique”
  - web skills in common / simple frameworks
  - dashboard, interactive viz end-to-end creation
  - startups mentality (MVP, working on many different things, lots of breadth, learn fast, can work with people from very different teams & backgrounds)

- ML engineer
  - both eng & conceptually
  - know & understand the models, conceptually, modularly, and pros & cons to domains
  - know how the model incorporates every stage from dataset acquisition, preprocessing, feature engineering, to how it is used commercially, to infrastructure, pipeline, iterating, testing, comparing, versioning models
  - diagnosing, logging
  - interpreting, understanding, explaining the model, identifying features, simplifying the model

- team player, others in mind
  - communication skills with different backgrounds
  - mentoring skills
  - documentation skills & advocate
  - conceptually: the details, naming stuff, being clear, comments, reusable, modular code
  - VCS, git, sharing datasets, models, code, preprocessing code, sharing the whole pipeline so that anyone can work on it
  - collaboration
  - prise d’initiative, pioneer for something non-standard in DS
  - writing domain-specific APIs
