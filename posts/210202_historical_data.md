title: Never Update, always Version Control
---

Updating means information is overwritten. The information is **historical data** that can be useful in the future.

The trade-off
---

We update by default because it's simpler.
Keeping historical data requires more complex infrastructure work wrt building the version control, connecting it up, deciding how to display / access the versions (**UI/UX work**)
