title: A general approach to a data science project
---

Here’s my answer to an interview question asking how I would explain how I approach a data science project to someone not in this field.

> I would begin to ask them (the non-specialist) questions as to why they are asking, what they are hoping to learn from asking, as the question is very broad. I’m going to assume the point of view of someone who wants to understand the process, via the timeline and via the concepts to pay attention to.
> 
> A data science process will roughly have the following steps: asking a question, collecting data, seeing how the data answers the question (called the modeling phase), and presenting the results.
> 
> Having a clear question shapes the rest of the process so it’s important to take time to understand the domain: making sure to ask the stakeholders, experts etc. to guide the process.
> 
> There can be an exploratory data analysis phase to quickly see if some expected or not patterns exist, and inspire potential further research.
> 
> Good datasets take work to obtain & build. This is the major part of any data science project. Think about choice of the datasets, sources, types. Asking what bias and assumptions exists, what that would entail for the outcomes, and what steps can already be taken at the data collection phase to account for that. Gathering the dataset, cleaning, checking assumptions, transforming or combining datasets, and iterating on those steps if needed.
> 
> Iteration is similarly important for the modeling phase. Starting with simple models, checking the results and iterating with more complex models only if necessary.
> 
> When analysing the results, it’s important to look deeper than a couple simple metrics and look at how smaller details of the model will affect stakeholders.
> 
> Data visualisations can be built to understand the results by eye faster. Similar care needs to be taken to choose visualisations that are understandable.
