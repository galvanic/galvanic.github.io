        <h1>About</h1>

      <div class='content'><p>Hi I’m Justine. After a biotechnology degree where I studied everything from biochemistry, to neuroscience to modeling complex systems, I moved in to the machine learning field where I studied intelligence from a different perspective (can we automate it ?)</p>
<p>I always fancied myself as a spy so I started my career in the information security industry, breaking systems to better understand them. I worked on facial verification algorithms. I noticed patterns in what I was doing and got interested into systemising and automating the software I was building so I’ve dipped my toe into Ops.</p>
<p>On the side, I’ve been social dancing (ie. dancing with a partner) for over 4 years; the gateway drug was Lindy Hop and Swing dances in general (charleston, blues, balboa), and I’ve since moved onto fusion dancing, argentine tango, brazilian zouk and kizomba. I’m interested in movement practices, both from a biomechanics and evolutionary point of view, and a relational point of view: why I practice partner dancing, martial arts.</p>
