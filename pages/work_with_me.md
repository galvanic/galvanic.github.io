- scoping your tech project. ~1 hour to go over your idea, what it will look like, what technologies you’ll need for it, what choices and possibilities exist and what I would recommend depending on your situation.

- pair programming consulting. ~1 hour to assist you in refactoring your codebase. We’ll review the project architecture, its inputs & outputs, dependencies and performance. We can focus on a systems level or on the bare metal of your code! We’ll follow best practices, maintainability, readability and understanding trade-offs.

- join my journal club. ~1 hour each week to review a paper or article about a common interest: see my About page
